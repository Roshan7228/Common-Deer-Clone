Rosewood in perfumery shot to fame with the original Chanel No. 5 formula, and the scent has since been incorporated in famous Perfume Houses including Dior, Givenchy, and Diptyque.   Rosewood Oil also comes with a dark history where high demand for this gorgeous wood has sadly left the Rosewood trees endangered.
